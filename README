tpp - text presentation program
===============================

What is tpp?
------------

tpp stands for text presentation program and is an ncurses-based
presentation tool. The presentation can be written with your favorite
editor in a simple description format and then shown on any text
terminal that is supported by ncurses - ranging from an old VT100 to the
Linux framebuffer to an xterm.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites: 
  * Ruby 1.8 <http://www.ruby-lang.org/
  * a recent version of ncurses
  * ncurses-ruby <http://ncurses-ruby.berlios.de/>

Optionalls:
  * FIGlet (if you want to have huge text printed)

Installing tpp:

  Just copy tpp.rb to your favorite location, e.g. ~/bin or
  /usr/local/bin.


Using tpp
---------


Start tpp with the presentation file you would like to display:

$ tpp presentation.tpp


To control tpp, the following keys are available:

space bar .............................. display next entry within page
space bar, cursor-down, cursor-right ... display next page
b, cursor-up, cursor-left .............. display previous page
q, Q ................................... quit tpp
j, J ................................... jump directly to page

Writing tpp presentations
-------------------------

The tpp presentation formats consists of normal text lines and special
commands. Special commands are contained in lines that begin with "--"
and the command name.

The presentation is divided into 1 more pages, which are separated by
the "--newpage". Before the first "--newpage" is encountered, all
non-command text is used as the presentation's abstract. Here, the
title, the author and the date can be set, too. You can also optionally
specify a name for a page, which append it to the "--newpage" command,
separated by a single blank. If no name is set, a name will be
automatically generated.

Within a page, so-called "page-local" commands can be used. The
following page-local commands are available:

--heading <heading>: draw a heading. Headings will be centered and drawn
    in bold (if supported by the terminal).

--center <text>: center <text>. The text will be drawn centered.

--right <text>: draw <text> right-oriented. When drawing the text, it
    will be aligned on the right side of the terminal.

---: stop drawing until space bar has been pressed.

--beginoutput: marks the beginning of a framed output

--endoutput: marks the end of a framed output

--beginshelloutput: marks the beginning of a framed shell output. The
    difference between normal output and shell output is that lines that
    start with $ are printed as if they were typed by a person.

--endshelloutput: marks the end of a shell output

--sleep <seconds>: tpp stops for 3 seconds, doing nothing and accepting
    no input.
    
--boldon: switches on bold printing
--boldoff: switches off bold printing

--revon: switches on reverse printing (i.e. reverse fg and bg colors)
--revoff: switches off reverse printing

--ulon: switches on underlined printing
--uloff: switches off underlined printing

--huge <text>: <text> is drawn in huge letters. FIGlet is used to
    generate the huge letters.
